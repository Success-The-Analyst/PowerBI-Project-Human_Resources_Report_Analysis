# PowerBI-Project-Human_Resources_Attrition_Report_Analysis

## Overview

This Power BI project presents an analysis of employee attrition data across different departments and job roles. The report provides insights into attrition rates by education, age, salary slab, years at the company, and job role. The goal of this analysis is to help HR departments understand the reasons behind employee turnover and make informed decisions to reduce attrition and improve retention strategies.

## Key Analytics Sections:

1. **Attrition by Education**: A pie chart that shows the distribution of attrition across different educational backgrounds, helping to identify if certain educational categories have higher turnover rates.

2. **Attrition by Age**: A bar chart that visualizes attrition by age group, highlighting the age demographics most affected by employee turnover.

3. **Attrition by Salary Slab**: A bar chart that displays attrition rates based on salary ranges. This insight can help assess if employees in lower or higher salary slabs are more likely to leave the organization.

4. **Attrition by Years at Company**: A line chart that visualizes how attrition varies with the number of years employees have spent at the company, highlighting trends in employee retention.

5. **Attrition by Gender**: A visualization that shows the attrition count for male and female employees, helping to understand if gender plays a role in employee turnover.

6. **Attrition by Job Role**: A bar chart that shows the distribution of attrition across different job roles, helping to identify which roles have higher turnover rates.

7. **Employee Count and Attrition Rate**: Key statistics showing the total number of employees, the overall attrition count, and the attrition rate for the company.

## Approach:

### Data Collection:
The data used for this report was gathered from employee records, segmented by education, age, gender, salary, years at the company, and job role. The dataset includes key metrics such as attrition, gender distribution, and salary ranges.

### Data Transformation:
Data was cleaned and transformed in Power BI, where key metrics like attrition rate, employee count, and segment-wise attrition were calculated.

### Visualizations:
Power BI was used to create visually appealing dashboards to provide insights into employee attrition trends. Multiple charts were created to visualize the following:
- Attrition by education, age, salary slab, years at the company, and job role
- Gender-wise attrition distribution
- Overall attrition rate for the company

### Insights & Actions:
- **Education and Attrition**: By analyzing attrition by education, organizations can evaluate if certain educational backgrounds experience higher turnover, which may inform hiring or retention strategies.
- **Age and Experience**: Attrition trends by age and years at the company reveal which age groups and experience levels are more likely to leave, helping to target retention programs for these groups.
- **Salary and Retention**: The analysis of attrition by salary slab helps understand if compensation packages are influencing turnover, suggesting areas for improvement in salary or benefits.
- **Job Role Analysis**: By identifying which job roles have the highest attrition, the organization can focus on improving working conditions or career growth opportunities for those specific roles.
